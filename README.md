Implementing Android Asynchronous Http Client in Kotlin using Loopj library

Introduction:

Loopj is an Android library for making asynchronous HTTP requests. I like it for its ease of use and simplicity. Created by James Smith, it's also known as "Android Asynchronous HTTP Client", and it's used by companies like Instagram, Pinterest, and many others. It's a good entry point to the world of HTTP libraries, and will help you understand important concepts very easily.

To learn to use this library, we are going to create MovieTrivia, a simple app that connects to a web service to retrieve information about movies or TV shows and displays this information to the user.
